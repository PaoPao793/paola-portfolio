                            I was born and raised in Guanajuato, Mexico, I moved to Maryland, USA, in 2011. 
                            I am now a senior at the University of Maryland, College Park, pursuing a degree in computer 
                            science with a minor in linguistics. My academic journey has fueled my passion for technology 
                            and language, blending the structure of code with the intricacies of human communication.

                            I am drawn to full-stack development, where creativity meets

                            making sure that an idea is able to come to life. 
                            Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring the world through books, scenic walks, and the challenge of solving intricate 
                            jigsaw puzzlesâ€”activities that keep my problem-solving skills sharp and my imagination alive.
